    <div id="welcome">Before you continue on your path again, you notice a crystal jewel on the ground and shove it into one of your pockets. You believe that it might have some value later on. You are gliding back onto the path and are going for a long while. Soon enough there are small, elusive figures in human form with pointed ears, and a capricious nature appearing to be crossing your path to head in a different direction. You think that they might be capable of having magical powers. You take notice that they seem to be arguing of whether or not to return home or keep on exploring this land for a while longer. You overhear that they have not been home for months and feel sympathy for them. You want to head home too if there even is one for you. You are not sure where home is or if there are other people like yourself. You break away from your thoughts and decide to possibly offer an opinion for them. Do you tell them to return to their homeland or to blantly walk away from them?
