    <div id="welcome"><font face="arial" color="yellow">You wake up and notice that you are on the ground deep in a forest. You cannot seem to remember how or why you were sleeping on the ground. You realize that there is no one else around and notice that you hold no weapons in your grasp. You see no trace of civilization and decide it is best to start walking on a path, hoping you will find others like you soon enough. You start at a fast pace but soon enough realize it is no use to waste so much energy. Therefore, you start to walk at a normal pace and then somewhere along the way, the path stretches out into two different directions. You want to go through both ways, but you know that you cannot. You must choose a direction to go in and keep going from there. </div>
