    <div id="welcome"> You keep walking and you notice that your legs are growing tired. You decide to get off the path and rest under a tree. You do not even notice how soothing it is to sit down. Your head is clearing and you canâ€™t help but wonder when you will eat or better yet drink something soon. You miss it at first but you think that you heard a swooshing sound. You think it is your mind messing with you. However, you listen in on it again and notice that it is a swooshing sound going on in a close distance behind the trees. You stand up and use your ears. You move around until you are sure your ears know for sure where the sound is coming from. You walk towards the sounds and push back a bunch of branches. You view a whole pool of water. (insert image of a whole pool water) You take notice of the glimmer there is and realize that you ache to drink that liquid <font face="arial">
