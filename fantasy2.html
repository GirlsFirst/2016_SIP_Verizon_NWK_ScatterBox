    <div id="welcome"><font face="arial" color="yellow">As you are walking along the path, you encounter an angry looking creature a couple of feet away. It takes you a few moments to realize that it is a troll. You and the troll have a staredown. You begin to wonder what a troll is doing out here, but then realize that the troll might be wondering why you are out here too. You realize that the troll appears to have a magic bag that you do not think belongs to them. Do you want to take the trollâ€™s magic bag or peacefully put your hands up to signal that you will walk away?  </div>
