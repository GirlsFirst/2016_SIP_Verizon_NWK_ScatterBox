    <div id="welcome"><font face="arial" color="yellow">You wake up and notice that you are not on Earth, but in a spaceship; and you see a VHS tape with a “Play Me” sign, so you decide to put it in the slot. On the tape there is a broadcast of the president saying that the Earth was unsustainable, and that they had to do an immediate evacuation to space. Although that’s bad, the biggest problem with this is that the year, on the screen, says “4000”; even though you went to sleep with it only being 2016. The ship’s controls say “Go To Another Realm”, and “Explore Outside”. You want more information on what is happening, but don’t know which to choose. (Note: clicking “Go To Another Realm” will bring you to the home page.) </div>
