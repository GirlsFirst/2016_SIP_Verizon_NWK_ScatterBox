<font face="arial">Finally you found the castle . Creepy and scary as they imagined it and looks like 100 years old without a living soul in it. They walked scared up the creaking stairs and before opening the door there’s a letter that says you’re name on the door handle the letter said from unknown, “ Congrats on making it to this far most people would been eaten or died. But to let you know this just the beginning of all your dreams. P.S, watch out for ghosts.” After reading the letter they both open the creaking door and went inside.In this mission there two paths that leads to the mummy’s tomb. Path one has ghost floating around and path two is filled with a heavy misty fog. Both path can lead both characters to death. If they choose “Ghost” then they go through the path with the ghost and they survive and can get to the mummy.
