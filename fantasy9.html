    <div id="welcome">The wizard disappears as quickly as it first arrived. You continue walking along the path and jump into mid-air when you see a tree on fire. You quickly try to see what caused the fire and see a ferocious dragon not too many feet away having an intense stare down with a goblin. You notice a sword tucked away in the grass a mere couple of feet away. You notice that there is no other way around either creature. Also, you notice that neither has sensed your presence. You could either slay the dragon and goblin or run away from both creatures.<font face="arial">
