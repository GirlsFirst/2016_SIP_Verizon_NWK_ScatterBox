The other person (Fred) with you knows the place and knows that the mummy is hidden in a haunted castle. Both of you look around for any hints or signs to find the castle. From a far distance Fred finds a map to the castle. Thereâ€™s five paths that leads to the castle. This mission you will need to find the haunted castle. Both paths are filled with monsters (vamp, were, and zom) you have to fight the monsters.
