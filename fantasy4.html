    <div id="welcome"><font face="arial" color="yellow">You decide to not question why any more creatures are here in this forest as well since it is more important for you to find civilization. As you are moving along on the path, you make a sharp left turn as indicated on the path. You are led down a path that seems to be away from all of these trees that you have gotten used to seeing. Soon enough you notice a sea of water along the left side. You did not even realize that you missed looking at a clear liquid. You feel the need to drink up some water. Before you even try to scoop up some water in your hands, you hear a loud prolonged sound coming from a distance in the water. You cannot help but marvel at the sirenâ€™s beauty and do not know whether or not to swim towards the siren. </div>
