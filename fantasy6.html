    <div id="welcome"><font face="arial">You are striding along the path when you notice something tucked away by branches in the trees. You think that there is no harm in checking out the branches of the trees. You think that maybe it is an animal and hope that it may have food on them. You notice that tucked away behind a branch is a steel cage. You squint your eyes and notice a sad-looking fairy trapped in the cage. Do you move away from the cage to head on back on your path or do you unlock the cage for the fairy to escape?
